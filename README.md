# BiLatticeRNN-data-processing

This repository provides some data processing pipeline and exploration tools for HTK lattices and confusion networks as required by https://github.com/alecokas/BiLatticeRNN-Confidence.

The scripts are divided into two categories: those which are included in the data processing pipeline and those which are used to obtain statistics or information from the dataset
